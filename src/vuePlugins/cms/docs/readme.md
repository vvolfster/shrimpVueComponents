# ZCmsSystem for Vue

The ZCmsSystem is a Vue plugin that uses the Vue.Mixin function to embed itself in every VueComponent.
Use this only on components that are self-sufficient enough to handle their own change.

There are certain requirements that each vue component must have in order to work properly with the system. 
These are covered in the Descriptors section. 

The goal of this system is to spend as little time as necessary on writing cms for vue components.
